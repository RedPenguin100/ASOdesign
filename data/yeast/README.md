In this path, we expect to find

Downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000146045.2/
genomic.gff - contains many annotations for yeast
GCF_000146045.2_R64_genomic.fna - fasta file contains the actual sequences of yeast

yeast_gff.db - will be (optionally) created if you choose. Slow to create, but speeds up yeast load time.

SGD_all_ORFs_3prime_UTRs.fsa - contains extended annotations for 3'UTR
SGD_all_ORFs_5prime_UTRs.fsa - contains extended annotations for 5'UTR
